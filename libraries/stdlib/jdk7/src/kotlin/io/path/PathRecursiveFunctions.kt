 * Unlike `File.copyRecursively`, if some directories on the way to the [target] are missing, then they won't be created automatically.
 * You can use the following approach to ensure that required intermediate directories are created:
 * ```
 * sourcePath.copyToRecursively(destinationPath.apply { parent?.createDirectories() }, followLinks = false)
 * ```
 *
 * If the file located by this path is a directory, this function recursively copies the directory itself and its content.
 * Otherwise, this function copies only the file.
 *
 * If an exception occurs attempting to read, open or copy any file under the given file tree,
 * further actions will depend on the result of the [onError] invoked with
 * the file that caused the error and the exception itself as arguments.
 * By default [onError] rethrows the exception, leading to immediate termination of the recursive copy function.
 * See [OnErrorResult] for available options.
 *
 * This function performs "directory merge" operation. If a file in the source subtree is a directory
 * and the corresponding file in the target subtree already exists and is also a directory, it does nothing.
 * Otherwise, [overwrite] determines whether to overwrite existing destination files and directories.
 * Attributes of a source file, such as creation/modification date, are not preserved.
 * [followLinks] determines whether copy a symbolic link itself or its target.
 * Symbolic links in the target subtree are not followed.
 *
 * To provide a custom logic for copying use the overload that takes a `copyAction` lambda.
 *

 * @param onError the function that decides further actions if an error occurs. By default, rethrows the exception.
 * @param followLinks `false` to copy a symbolic link itself, not its target.
